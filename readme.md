# MovieQuiz

This is a simple app I developed at the Apple Developer Academy back in 2015. It was originally written in Objective-C and shortly after remade in Swift 2. Recently I updated the app to Swift 5 to improve code quality and ensure compatibility going forward. It was the first app I ever published on the App Store.

You can check it out the released version [here](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/moviequiz-synopsis-trivia/id993354458?l=en).

Feel free to clone or fork the project, but please don't publish simple copies of the app.

## Dependencies

The app only uses [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) as a dependency.

In order to build it, you must create an `APIKeys.swift` file and fill it with your own [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com) and [IMDb-API](https://imdb-api.com) keys.

## Privacy Policy

This app collects no data from your phone. It requires an Internet connection simply to fetch movie information from the two APIs listed above.

## Support
